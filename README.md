**Introduction**  
Credit card fraud is a huge issue in the financial sector. Detecting fraudulent transactions can help prevent financial losses and protect users. This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraud in credit card transactions as well as train the model using more Kaggle files to increase throughput and accuracy.  
  
**Dataset**  
The dataset consists of multiple CSV files that I pulled from Kaggle containing credit card transaction information by the xxx,000's. Each file includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and more. The target variable in question, Class, indicates whether or not a transaction is fraudulent with the use of 0 or 1, 0 being legit and 1 being fraudulent.
