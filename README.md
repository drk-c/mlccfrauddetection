## Introduction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraud in credit card transactions as well as train the model using more Kaggle files to increase throughput and accuracy. The dataset used for this project consists of multiple CSV files containing transaction information, which are combined, preprocessed, and used to train various machine learning models.   

## Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files that I pulled from Kaggle containing credit card transaction information by the xxx,000's. Each file includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and more. The target variable in question, Class, indicates whether or not a transaction is fraudulent with the use of 0 or 1, 0 being legit and 1 being fraudulent.  


## Models
Models used include:  
Linear Regression  
Logistic Regression  
Random Forest Classifier  
KNN  
  
## Evaluation
I evaluated the models based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and score. I also used confusion matrices to visualize the model performance.
